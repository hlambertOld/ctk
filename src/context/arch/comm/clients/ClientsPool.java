/**
 * This class defines a pool of threads that can handle a communication.
 * When a BaseObject wants to send an asynchronous message to another CTK object,
 * it creates the RequestObject, added it to a IndependentCommunication object,
 * which is the parameter of the BaseObject.independentUserRequest() call.
 * This IndependentCommunication is added to a synchronized FIFO vector (SynchFIFO
 * object) from which the ClientsPool get the request to send.
 *
 * Then, as soon as a IndependentCommunication is added to the SynchFIFO, the ClientsPool object 
 * removes it to give it to a thread (Client object) from the pool. 
 * When a Client object is asked to handle an IndependentCommunication, it is
 * also removed from the pool.
 * The Client object sends the request to the given CTK object, and get the 
 * reply and the exceptions.
 *
 * In order for the BaseObject to get the reply, the IndependentCommunication contains
 * also 2 useful attributes : the DataObject reply and the Vector exceptions.
 * Then the Client object adds the reply to the same object it gets as well as 
 * the exception it could have caught.
 * After updating the IndependentCommunication object, the Client calls the 
 * BaseObject handleIndependentReply method with the parameter an object containing
 * the same IndependentCommunication object.
 *
 * At the end of the communication, the IndependentCommunication object contains
 * the original request, the reply (if any) and the exceptions that occured (if any);
 * and is sent back to the BaseObject, that does nothing by default.
 * If a widget or server or interpreter wants to handle the reply, it overrides the
 * BaseObject handleIndependentReply method, and may check the reply for each
 * request it has sent.
 *
 * In order to group a bunch of requests (for example, a widget sends many PINGs to 
 * its subscribers) we define a IndependentCommunications object to help handling
 * the replies. 
 * Before sending the requests, the widget creates an IndependentCommunications 
 * object in which all IndependentCommunication objects will be added by the Client
 * thread at the end of the communication.
 * The IndependentCommunications object is specified while calling the 
 * BaseObject independentUserRequest. If it is null, the Client thread will create 
 * a new one, add the IndependentCommunication object in it, and send it to 
 * the BaseObject handleIndependentReply method.
