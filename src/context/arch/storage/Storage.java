 * This interface specifies all the methods a Storage object must support

 *
 * Note: currently, the constructors are expected to have the following
 * format:
 *        1) empty constructor (no parameters)
 *        2) constructor(Integer i, Long l) where i is the type
 *             of flushing to use (TIME/DATA) and l is either the
 *             number of milliseconds between flushes or number of
 *             stores between flushes.
